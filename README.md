# üí´ About Me:
I am a Software Engineer with 16+ years of experience architecting and implementing scalable solutions for startups and global enterprises.<br><br>I love turning ideas into reality, using tech to solve complex business challenges and helping teams create successful products. For 8+ years, I have led making products from scratch at startups, helping teams innovate and succeed.

## Why Contribute on GitHub:

I started making projects on GitHub because I couldn't find complete projects that show how everything works from start to finish. These projects are like examples that can help you understand things better. Just clone the repository, and you're set to use it in your project or learn through practical examples. 

Let's strengthen our skills together! For more information, drop me a message at yusuf.aziz@gmail.com
